Java travelport-uapi-tutorial
========================

This Java tutorial provides the building blocks for coding a flight and hotel booking application in [Travelport Universal API](http://developer.travelport.com/app/developer-network/universal-api). It teaches you how to setup and configure Travelport Universal API and how to send basic requests. You will learn how to request Air and Rail travel information such as schedules, availability and pricing and search for a hotel using city and reference points and complete a booking for a passenger. 

You can read the [tutorial online via Github](http://travelport.github.com/travelport-uapi-tutorial/) or you can clone the repository and examine the branch 'gh-pages'.

If you have questions or comments, please post them to the [issue tracker in Github](https://github.com/Travelport/travelport-uapi-tutorial/issues).

If you are experienced with WSDL and C#, we would love to see a port of this code to C# for those more familiar with Windows development. You can submit this port to us with a pull request.
